# CURSOR Rules for Canvas Design Skill

## Overview
This skill creates beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. It follows a two-step process: creating design philosophy, then expressing it visually on canvas.

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Design Philosophy Creation Rules
**Structure Requirements:**
- Name the movement (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy", "Chromatic Silence", "Metabolist Dreams"
- Write 4-6 substantial paragraphs
- Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY
- Leave creative space for visual interpretation
- Focus on visual expression, not text

**Content Guidelines:**
- Avoid redundancy - each design aspect mentioned once
- Emphasize "meticulously crafted," "product of deep expertise," "painstaking attention"
- Guide toward visual expression, not paragraphs
- Information lives in design, not text

### Visual Philosophy Rules
**Core Principles:**
- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create aesthetic worldview expressed through design
- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element
- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: Provide creative room for visual interpretation
- **PURE DESIGN**: Create ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care

### Canvas Creation Rules
**Quality Standards:**
- Museum or magazine quality work
- Single page, highly visual, design-forward
- Use repeating patterns and perfect shapes
- Treat abstract philosophical design as scientific bible
- Dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, layered patterns
- Sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers

**Text as Visual Element:**
- Text is always minimal and visual-first
- Context guides whether whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures
- Font should be thin most of the time
- All font usage must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication
- Nothing falls off the page, nothing overlaps
- Every element contained within canvas boundaries with proper margins

## Technical Implementation Rules

### Font Usage Rules
**Font Selection:**
- Use different fonts if writing text
- Search the `./canvas-fonts` directory
- Get creative by making typography part of the art itself
- If art is abstract, bring font onto canvas, not typeset digitally
- Download and use whatever fonts needed

### Design Principles
**Sophistication Requirements:**
- Never lose sight that this should be art, not cartoony or amateur
- Push boundaries following design instinct/intuition
- Use philosophy as guiding principle
- Embrace ultimate design freedom and choice
- Push aesthetics and design to the frontier

**Quality Standards:**
- Work must look like it took countless hours
- Appear as though someone at absolute top of their field labored over every detail
- Composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship
- Nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect
- Create something that could be shown to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive

### Refinement Rules
**Final Step Requirements:**
- User ALREADY said "It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece of craftsmanship"
- Avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created
- Make it extremely crisp, respecting design philosophy and minimalism principles
- If instinct is to call new function or draw new shape, STOP
- Ask: "How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"
- Take second pass - go back to code and refine/polish further

## Output Format Rules

### Required Outputs
1. Design Philosophy (.md file)
2. Single downloadable .pdf or .png file

### Multi-Page Option Rules
**When Creating Additional Pages:**
- Create more creative pages along same lines as design philosophy
- Make them distinctly different as well
- Bundle pages in same .pdf or many .pngs
- Treat first page as single page in whole coffee table book waiting to be filled
- Make next pages unique twists and memories of original
- Have them almost tell a story in very tasteful way
- Exercise full creative freedom
